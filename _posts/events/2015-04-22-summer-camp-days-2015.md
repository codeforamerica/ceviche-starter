# Summer Escape Day Camp

The Summer Escape Day Camp is for children entering kindergarten thru 6th grade in the fall 2015.  Weekly activities may include excursions, sports, arts &amp; crafts, indoor/outdoor games, dance, drama and other special activities. Summer Escape is committed to safety first and creating a positive environment where children can spend their time in quality programs that are safe, educational and FUN! 

For children going into 4th – 6th grades, we are tentatively scheduled to go swimming at either Lions Pool or the East Oakland Sports Center on Tuesdays.  There is no scheduled swimming for the younger children due to height requirements & staff / child ratio in the pool.  The City of Oakland Aquatics Department offers weekly swimming lessons for great prices.  Please contact them regarding swim lessons.

The Jr. High Club is designed for middle school children entering 7th & 8th grades in the fall 2015.  Weekly activities include excursions, sports, arts & crafts, indoor/outdoor games, drama, dance; peddle boating & kayaking on Lake Merritt, golfing and other special activities which may include a movie trip during the summer.
